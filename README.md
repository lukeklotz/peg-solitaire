# 🧠 Peg Solitaire in React
I recently played Peg Solitaire and thought it would be fun to make a version of the game in react, so here we are!

## Goal: Remove all but one peg from the board.

Captures are made by jumping a peg over another. Moves are only allowed if you can capture on that move.

# 🚧 TODOs & Future Plans:
## ❌ Fix movement logic
Right now, pieces can move semi-freely. Moves should only be allowed when jumping over another piece.

## 🔄 Game Over Detection
When no more moves are possible, let the user know and offer a restart.

## 🎨 Make it pretty
The UI is... functional.

## 🏆 Leaderboard
Wouldn't it be cool to track top scores? Planning to hook up a database to show off those Peg Masters.
