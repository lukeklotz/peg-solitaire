#🧠 Peg Solitaire in React
I recently played Peg Solitaire and thought it would be fun to make a version of the game in react, so here we are!

Goal: Remove all but one peg from the board.

Captures are made by jumping a peg over another. Moves are only allowed if you can capture on that move.

🚧 TODOs & Future Plans:
❌ Fix movement logic
Right now, pieces can move freely—oops! Let's fix it so moves only happen when jumping over another piece (as per the classic rules).

🔄 Game Over Detection
When no more moves are possible, let the user know and offer a restart. Don’t leave them hanging!

🎨 Make it pretty
The UI is... functional. Time for some style upgrades.

🏆 Leaderboard
Wouldn't it be cool to track top scores? Planning to hook up a database to show off those Peg Masters.
